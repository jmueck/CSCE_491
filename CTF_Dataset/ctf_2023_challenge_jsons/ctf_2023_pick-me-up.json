When does this flight actually arrive and where should you pick her up? This screenshot was taken on 4/20. \n\nThe flag format is `gigem{HH:MM-Gate}` in CDT with HH being hour **in 24 hour time** and MM for the minutes. Gate represents the gate that the plane arrives at. For example, if you were picking your friend up at 4:20 PM CDT at gate A1 would yield the flag `gigem{16:20-A1}`.\n\n## Solution\n\nTranslating the messages in the screenshot reveals that the passenger is flying out of Taipei to IAH. I used the Houston airport website to search for this flight. \n\n<https://www.airport-houston.com/>\n\nAs listed in the flight record on the website, the flight landed at 12:28 at gate D7.\n\n<https://www.airport-houston.com/iah-flight-arrival/BR52>\n\nflag:\n`gigem{00:28-D7}`\n",
