We have sent agents out to all three of these locations but there was no luck finding them. Where else could they be meeting up?\n\nLocation 1: 1462 N Beauregard St B\nLocation 2: 801 N Glebe Rd\nLocation 3: 2925 S Glebe Rd\n\nFlag format will be the street address with spaces replaced with underscores, for example: `gigem{200_Discovery_Dr}`\n\n## Solution\n\nI made a Google Earth project and pinned each of the three locations which formed a triangle. Searching \"Starbucks\" shows one location in the center of the triangle. The address of that Starbucks is the flag.\n\nflag:\n`gigem{950_S_George_Mason_Dr}`\n",
